### CodeKit

Phone1st is designed to be used with [CodeKit](https://codekitapp.com/) (_Mac only_). Taking advantage of _CodeKits_ - _kit_ templates and _kit_ variables.

If you don't have _CodeKit_ the _css_ folder and _scss_ files may be adapted to suit your use.

The theme should build correctly when imported into Codekit, but if not:

_You can delete the **build** folder and **re-build**._

_Remove the **config.codekit3** file and re-import into **CodeKit** using your CodeKit settings_

_You can set the paths to suit yourself but phone1st uses:_

- style.scss - /build/css/style.css
- app.js - /build/js/app.js
- images - /build/images/
- index.kit - /build/index.html


To view the _test folder pages_

- test.kit - /build/test/test.html
- about.kit - /build/test/about.html
- scss.kit - /build/test/scss.html
- base.scss - /build/test/css/base.css

- all test images to /build/test/test-images/
